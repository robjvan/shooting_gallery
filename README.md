## Versions

### v0.1 COMPLETED - "First Prototype"

  <i>It wasn't the prettiest</i>
</p>
 This version requires a makeshift "controller" to test the various circuits.  The controller consists of 2 x PS2 joysticks to control throttle and steering with pushbuttons to sound the horn and toggle the headlights.  The objective was to confirm feasibility and create basic code to have all parts interact properly.

### v0.2 WIP - "Cutting the cords"

 Planned for Sept/Oct 2020, waiting for parts from China.  A bluetooth receiver will enable wireless operation and plastic gears will allow the motor to turn a drive axle.
